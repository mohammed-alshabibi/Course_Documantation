## Web development stacks

### Overview  
In web applications, we have three main layers, each with its own services:  
- **Data Tier**: Database services  
- **Logic Tier**: Backend services  
- **Presentation Tier**: Frontend services

A **web development stack** is a set of tools and technologies used to build web applications.

### Popular Web Development Stacks  
- **.NET Stack**: Uses C#, SQL Server, and the .NET framework. Ideal for high-performance web applications.  
- **MERN Stack**: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.  
- **MEAN Stack**: Similar to MERN but uses Angular instead of React.  
- **Serverless Stack**: Uses cloud infrastructure for scalability and cost-effectiveness.  
- **LAMP Stack**: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.  
- **PERN Stack**: Similar to MERN but with PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB.  
- **Ruby on Rails Stack**: Uses Ruby on Rails along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, known for security and simplicity.  

### .NET Full-Stack Development  

### **Frontend**  
- **Client-side rendering**: Blazor, Angular, Next.js  
- **Server-side rendering**: MVC, Blazor  
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code  

### **Backend**  
- **Language**: C#  
- **Framework**: .NET Core  
- **IDE**: Visual Studio + SSMS  
- **API Development**: Connects frontend and backend  

### **Database**  
- **Database**: SQL Server  
- **ORM**: Entity Framework  

### **Testing**  
- **API Testing**: Postman  
- **Unit Testing**: xUnit  

### **Deployment**  
- **Technologies**: Docker, Azure  

### **Security**  
- **Standard**: OWASP  

### **Logging**  
- **Tool**: Serilog  

### **Payment Gateway**  
- **Service**: Stripe

## Git Version Control  

### Overview  
Git is a **distributed version control system (VCS)** used to track changes in source code during software development. It is widely used for **speed, efficiency, and collaboration**.  

### Why Use Git?  
- **Version Control**: Keep track of changes and revert to previous versions if needed.  
- **Cloud Backup**: Store code in a remote repository to prevent data loss.  
- **Collaboration**: Work with teams remotely on the same project.  

### Cloud Repositories  

There are many cloud repositories that use Git for version control. The most popular ones are:  

- **GitHub**: The most popular cloud-based Git repository, ideal for open-source projects and enterprise development.  
- **GitLab**: A complete DevOps platform offering Git repository hosting with built-in CI/CD.  
- **Azure Repos**: Microsoftâ€™s Git-based repository solution integrated with Azure services and DevOps tools.  

### Git Commands  

Here is a set of essential Git commands along with their descriptions:  

| Command | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` | Sets the username for Git commits. |
| `git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"` | Sets the email for Git commits. |
| `git init` | Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. |
| `git clone <repository_URL>` | Creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine. |
| `git status` | Shows the status of changes in the working directory. |
| `git log --oneline` | Shows commit history in a compact format. |
| `git log` | Displays commit history. |
| `git diff` | Shows changes between the working directory and the last commit. |
| `git add <file>` | Stages a specific file for the next commit. |
| `git commit -m "Commit message"` | Commits staged files with a descriptive message. |
| `git remote add origin <repository_URL>` | Connects a local repository to a remote one. |
| `git branch` | Lists all branches in the repository. |
| `git push origin <branch_name>` | Pushes changes to a remote repository. |
| `git pull` | Fetches and integrates changes from the remote repository. |

## Algorithm Examples  

### Introduction  
This repository contains different types of algorithms that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts. These include **sequential, iterative, and recursive approaches**, along with common problem-solving techniques such as finding the largest number in a list, counting vowels in a string, and reversing a string.  

### Algorithm Types  

#### 1. Sequential Algorithm  
A **sequential algorithm** executes step by step in a linear order, without using loops or recursion. It is the simplest type of algorithm.  
```pseudo
function sum(x,y)
  z=x+y
  return z
end function
```

#### 2. Iterative Algorithm (Using Loops)
An **iterative algorithm** repeats a set of instructions using loops until a condition is met. It is useful for tasks requiring repetition, such as calculating a factorial.
```pseudo
function factorial(n)
  result = 1
  for i = 1 to n:
    result = result * i
  end for loop
  return result
end function
```

#### 3. Recursive Algorithm (Function Calls Itself)
A **recursive algorithm** solves a problem by calling itself with a smaller input until a base case is reached. It is useful for problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems.
```pseudo
function factorial(n):
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  return n * factorial(n - 1)
end function
```

#### Examples:   
```pseudo
#Sum of Two Numbers
function sum(x, y)
  z = x + y
  return z
end function

#Find the Largest Number in a List
function largestNum(list):
  largest = first element in list
  for each element in list:
    if element > largest:
      largest = element
  end for loop
  return largest
end function

#Count the Number of Vowels in a String
function countVowels(string):
  count = 0
  for each letter in string:
    if letter is 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u': 
      count += 1
  end for loop
  return count
end function
