## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The "Software Development Life Cycle" document provides an in-depth look at the SDLC, a process used for planning, creating, testing, and deploying software applications. Key topics covered include:

- **Phases of SDLC**: Detailed descriptions of the various phases of the SDLC, including Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.
- **Models of SDLC**: Different models of the SDLC, such as Waterfall, V-Model, Incremental, and Agile, and their respective advantages and disadvantages.
- **Best Practices**: Recommended best practices for each phase of the SDLC to ensure the successful delivery of high-quality software projects.

##web development stacks

# Overview  
In web applications, we have three main layers, each with its own services:  
- **Data Tier**: Database services  
- **Logic Tier**: Backend services  
- **Presentation Tier**: Frontend services

A **web development stack** is a set of tools and technologies used to build web applications.

# Popular Web Development Stacks  
- **.NET Stack**: Uses C#, SQL Server, and the .NET framework. Ideal for high-performance web applications.  
- **MERN Stack**: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.  
- **MEAN Stack**: Similar to MERN but uses Angular instead of React.  
- **Serverless Stack**: Uses cloud infrastructure for scalability and cost-effectiveness.  
- **LAMP Stack**: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.  
- **PERN Stack**: Similar to MERN but with PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB.  
- **Ruby on Rails Stack**: Uses Ruby on Rails along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, known for security and simplicity.  

# .NET Full-Stack Development  

# **Frontend**  
- **Client-side rendering**: Blazor, Angular, Next.js  
- **Server-side rendering**: MVC, Blazor  
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code  

# **Backend**  
- **Language**: C#  
- **Framework**: .NET Core  
- **IDE**: Visual Studio + SSMS  
- **API Development**: Connects frontend and backend  

# **Database**  
- **Database**: SQL Server  
- **ORM**: Entity Framework  

# **Testing**  
- **API Testing**: Postman  
- **Unit Testing**: xUnit  

# **Deployment**  
- **Technologies**: Docker, Azure  

# **Security**  
- **Standard**: OWASP  

# **Logging**  
- **Tool**: Serilog  

# **Payment Gateway**  
- **Service**: Stripe
